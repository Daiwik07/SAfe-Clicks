                            In 2006, 13-year-old Megan Meier became the victim of cyberbullying when a fake online profile was created by Lori Drew, the mother of one of Megan's former friends. The profile, pretending to be a teenage boy named "Josh Evans," befriended Megan online and then cruelly turned against her, sending hurtful messages that eventually led to Megan's tragic death by suicide.
